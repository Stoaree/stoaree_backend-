### Purpose

- Stoaree is an online platform allowing users to share and create compelling interviews easily with another individual based off Mark Howards line of questions. After Mark Howard created his podcast "Howie Games" which has amassed up to 20 million listens he started to get contacted to interview the loved ones of his listeners who were either sick or elderly and to capture their story and how they came to be who they're today. This soon lead to the idea of Stoaree. The purpose of Stoaree is to allow users to easily capture compelling stories from family members, friends or interesting people based off the questions Mark asks in his podcasts. Along with capturing the stories it also becomes a place to share them with the world. A social aspect allowing users to listen to stories around them. Mark wants to also capture the important memories in people's lives and allow them to easily share them amongst family members and store them in one place.

### Functionality / features

- The functionality and features of the application is heavily based around audio and the telling of a story. The functionality of the application is to allow the user to perform the task of recording an story based on the questions asked through the application. Depending on each response by the user will depend on the questions asked through the application. The features of Stoaree will be:

2. Store stories which they have recorded on their profile,
3. Browse other stories and listen to other stories on the application,
4. Delete stories,
5. Browse other user profiles,
6. Keep stories private if users do not wish to share them,
7. Give stories tags making it easier to search/filter,
8. Search and find particular stories and/or users

### Target audience

- The target audience of Stoaree is between the ages of 40 - 70 both men and women. The target audience currently has a family and has progressed into their career, they now are beginning to think about what they're wanting to leave behind for their family as well as gaining all the information about their parents so their grandchildren can understand who they were as a person and get an understanding of what they went through in their lifetime.

- Though Stoaree is directed at an older demographic, there is a burgeoning younger community involved with podcasts and Youtube. We would like to get them sharing stories and connecting with people of all demographics, providing the service with as many meaningful stories as possible.
